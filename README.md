A few things about me:
* I host a weekly board game night, scheduled via EventBrite.
* I have a user profile on boardgamegeek.com.
* I'm trying to broaden by PHP skill set by learning how to build sites
in Laravel.

I had been working on a [a plugin to import my BoardGameGeek data into WordPress](https://github.com/jmichaelward/board-game-collector)
and [another plugin to retrieve information from EventBrite](https://github.com/jmichaelward/eventbrite-data),
which I was using to create custom endpoints in WordPress that another
front-end platform could consume. I still like that idea, but I figured
I'd take it a step further and bring everything in-house in Laravel,
which will still allow me to build a custom JavaScript front-end should
I decide to do so. For now, though, I plan to render these templates in
Blade and instead cement my understanding of how to build a custom site
in Laravel.

This repository may not be for public consumption. That said, I may
eventually break the BGG piece into a standalone component at some point,
so stay tuned. Just realize that, for now, this project is just for me
and that I'm willing to share the learning experience with the rest of
you.
